          <p>
            In the last decade, approximately 9,396 African rhinos have been killed due to poaching. From 2008, poaching
            numbers continued to increase across Africa until peaking in 2015, when 1,349 rhinos were killed.
            Fortunately, poaching has declined across the continent since then, but at least one rhino is still killed
            every day. The problem is particularly acute in South Africa, where more than 1,000 rhinos were killed each
            year between 2013 and 2017. 448 rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2022, a decrease of three from 2021(<a
              href="https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/poaching-stats/" target="_blank">Save the Rhino, 2018</a>).
          </p>

          <p>
            Regarding elephants, there are about 450,000 of them worldwide. African elephants are approximately ten
            times more numerous than Asian elephants. in 2015, African elephants numbered approximately 415,000, while
            Asian elephants numbered between 40,000 and 50,000. However, the African elephant population has shrunk by
            98% over the past few centuries, from 25 million in 1500. It is estimated that for every 100 elephants
            alive, about 12 have died. This indicates that elephant populations are declining. And Asian elephant
            populations have halved in the past century, from 100,000 in the early 1900s to 40,000 to 50,000 today(<a

            <p>
              Whales are critical to the food chain, stabilizing food flow and maintaining healthy oceans. As a result,
              a rapid decline in whale populations would have a major impact on marine ecosystems. Whales are critical
              to maintaining healthy marine life by regulating ocean food flow to maintain a healthy balance between
              different species. Whales play an important role in the energy flow and biological pump of marine life as
              a whole(<a href="http://whalingecosystems.weebly.com/ecosystem.html" target="_blank">Lian & Lu, 2019</a>).

              Elephants, as the largest land animals, are crucial for biodiversity. They create paths in dense
              vegetation, offering food and shelter to other animals. This behavior aids in preventing wildfires by
              controlling shrub growth. Moreover, elephants facilitate plant diversity by dispersing seeds. Their
              movements leave tracks that collect rainwater, serving as a vital water source for animals during the dry
              season.(<a

            <p>
              Rhinos are crucial to the ecosystem as long-standing species. They consume vegetation, shaping the African
              landscape and maintaining ecosystem balance. Local communities rely on rhino habitats for food, fuel, and
              income. As part of the "Big Five," rhinos attract tourists, providing income through ecotourism.
              Protecting rhinos safeguards their habitat, benefiting both people and wildlife. This work supports local
              communities and ensures future generations can enjoy natural resources.(<a

              People historically hunted whales primarily for whale oil, which was widely used for lighting (e.g.,
              street lamps, household lamps), lubricants, and even skin care products. Its demand peaked in the late
              19th century but declined and eventually ceased with the introduction of oil and other alternatives.
              Additionally, whale meat serves as a food source in countries like Japan, Norway, and the United
              States.(<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/whaling" target="_blank">Ritchie, 2022a</a>)。</p>

            <p>
              Elephants are hunted for their valuable ivory, which is in high demand, particularly in parts of Asia
              where it is considered a luxury item. There is also a market for elephant meat and skins. Despite efforts
              to curb the illegal ivory trade, elephants remain at risk of hunting due to the high value of these
              products.
            </p>
            <p>
              African elephants face large-scale hunting for ivory and habitat loss due to deforestation and
              agricultural expansion. Asian elephants are also affected but have a lower risk of poaching due to their
              less abundant tusks.(<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/elephant-populations" target="_blank">Ritchie,

            <p>
              Rhino hunting primarily occurs due to the demand for their horn and body parts. Rhino horn is highly
              valued as a luxury item and is used in traditional Chinese medicine and other purposes across Asia.
              Despite a ban on its medical use since 1993, the persistent belief in its medicinal properties fuels the
              demand for rhino horn, leading to poaching of these majestic animals.

          <h2>What we can do</h2>
          <p>
            Rhino populations have significantly increased due to global conservation efforts. Protection measures,
            especially in African nature reserves, have led to a remarkable rise in rhino numbers in the 20th century.
            The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has played a vital role in rhino conservation by protecting and relocating
            rhinos, as well as supporting community-based conservation. They also combat poaching through innovative
            techniques, bolstering patrolling capacity, and advocating for stronger enforcement against illegal
            trade.(<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rhino-populations" target="_blank">Ritchie, 2022b</a>；<a
              href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/rhino" target="_blank">(WWF, 2022)</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Current rhino population status: There are five species of rhinoceros, three of which (Sumatran rhinoceros,
            Javan rhinoceros and black rhinoceros) are considered "critically endangered". The other two species, the
            white rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros (greater single-horned rhinoceros), have shown some degree of
            recovery over the past few decades.</p>

          <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the southern white rhino population plummeted to just 20 individuals.
            However, after conservation efforts in the 20th century, the population has recovered to over 21,000.
            However, increased poaching in recent years has caused the population to decline again.
          </p>
          The Indian rhino population has grown from about 40 in the middle of the last century to more than 4,000
          today, thanks to conservation and poaching reduction efforts in India and Nepal.

          <h2>Call for animal protection</h2>
          <p>
            The conservation of animals such as rhinos, elephants and whales is a top priority. They play an important
            role in the ecosystem, but populations are declining dramatically. To save them, we need to take action.
            Increased enforcement against poaching, public awareness, habitat protection, international cooperation and
            global awareness are essential. Protecting animals is not only about them, but also about the survival of
            the Earth's ecosystem and biodiversity. No sale, no harm, now is the time to act, let's work together to
            protect these precious creatures and create a better world for the future.
