          <h2>Species population change</h2>
          <p>
            In the last decade, approximately 9,396 African rhinos have been killed due to poaching. From 2008, poaching numbers continued to increase across Africa until peaking in 2015, when 1,349 rhinos were killed. Fortunately, poaching has declined across the continent since then, but at least one rhino is still killed every day. The problem is particularly acute in South Africa, where more than 1,000 rhinos were killed each year between 2013 and 2017. 448 rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2022, a decrease of three from 2021(<a

            Regarding elephants, there are about 450,000 of them worldwide. African elephants are approximately ten times more numerous than Asian elephants. in 2015, African elephants numbered approximately 415,000, while Asian elephants numbered between 40,000 and 50,000. However, the African elephant population has shrunk by 98% over the past few centuries, from 25 million in 1500. It is estimated that for every 100 elephants alive, about 12 have died. This indicates that elephant populations are declining. And Asian elephant populations have halved in the past century, from 100,000 in the early 1900s to 40,000 to 50,000 today(<a

            <p>
              Whales are critical to the food chain, stabilizing food flow and maintaining healthy oceans. As a result, a rapid decline in whale populations would have a major impact on marine ecosystems. Whales are critical to maintaining healthy marine life by regulating ocean food flow to maintain a healthy balance between different species. Whales play an important role in the energy flow and biological pump of marine life as a whole(<a

            <p>
              "The decline in whale carcasses during the era of commercial whaling may have led to the earliest man-made extinction in the ocean," Joe Roman, a conservation biologist at the University of Vermont, Burlington, wrote in an email.  Dead whale carcasses are also an important food source in the ocean. When a whale dies, its several-ton body falls to the bottom of the ocean and feeds marine life deep underwater. The so-called "whale carcass" of a 40-ton gray whale provides seafloor organisms with the equivalent of more than 2,000 years of carbon growth in the normal cycle of debris and nutrients.(<a

              Elephants, the largest animal on land, play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity. By moving through their environment, they open up dense vegetation that provides food and habitat for other animals. This behavior not only provides essential biological resources, but also helps control the growth of shrubs, thus effectively limiting the occurrence of wildfires. In addition, elephants play a key role in the dispersal of plant seeds, which helps increase plant diversity in biological systems. Their mobile activities can leave deep tracks in the soil, which can accumulate rainwater during the dry season and become an important source of water for animals such as baboons and antelopes(<a

              Rhinos are a long-standing species that play a vital role in the ecosystem. As important herbivores, they consume a great deal of vegetation, which in turn shapes the magnificent African landscape. This behavior is not only beneficial to other animals, but also helps to maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem. Local people depend on the natural resources of the rhino's habitat for food, fuel and income. As one of the "Big Five" in Africa, rhinos are a popular tourist attraction. As such, ecotourism is an important source of income for the local people. By helping to protect rhinos, we are also protecting their habitat for the benefit of people and wildlife. This work also helps support local communities and ensures that future generations will continue to enjoy the bounty of natural resources(<a

              The main reason people hunted whales historically was primarily for whale oil. Whale oil was used extensively for lighting, such as street lamps and household lamp oil, as well as for lubricants and even in skin care products. The use of whale oil reached its peak in the late 19th century. However, with the advent of oil and other alternative products, the demand for whale oil began to decline and eventually ceased. Also, whale meat is used as a food source in some countries, such as Japan, Norway and the United States(<a

            <p>
              Elephants are commonly hunted and killed primarily because of the high value of their ivory. Elephant ivory is in high demand in the global market for illegal trade, especially in some parts of Asia, where it is considered a luxury item. In addition, there is a market for elephant meat and skins. Although the international community has clamped down on the illegal ivory trade, elephants are still under threat of being hunted due to the high value of these products.
            </p>
            <p>
              African elephants are hunted on a large scale for their ivory, and deforestation and agricultural expansion are cutting into their habitat. Asian elephants are in a similar situation, but because their tusks are not as abundant as those of African elephants, the threat of poaching is relatively low(<a

              The main reason for rhino hunting is the demand for rhino horn and body parts. Rhinoceros horn is considered a luxury item and is used in traditional Chinese medicine and for other purposes in Asian countries. Rhino horn is composed of keratin, a substance that can also be found in the beaks of parrots, the beaks of sea turtles and the hooves of horses. Although rhino horn has been banned for medical use since 1993, demand for rhino horn persists because many people believe it has medicinal properties, prompting poaching of rhinos

          <h2>What we can do</h2>
          <p>
            The increase in rhino populations is largely attributed to conservation efforts around the world. Close protection of these species, particularly in nature reserves in Africa, led to a remarkable and rapid increase in rhino populations during the 20th century. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has played an important role in rhino conservation efforts by actively and safely protecting rhino populations and establishing new populations through translocation, while assisting in community-based conservation approaches. In addition, they curb poaching by implementing innovative techniques and increasing the capacity of government and community patrollers, while combating the illegal trade by advocating and strengthening local and international enforcement efforts (<a
              href="https://ourworldindata.org/rhino-populations" target="_blank">Our World in Data, n.d.</a>；<a
              href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/rhino" target="_blank">World Wildlife Fund, n.d.</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Current rhino population status: There are five species of rhinoceros, three of which (Sumatran rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros and black rhinoceros) are considered "critically endangered". The other two species, the white rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros (greater single-horned rhinoceros), have shown some degree of recovery over the past few decades.</p>

          <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the southern white rhino population plummeted to just 20 individuals. However, after conservation efforts in the 20th century, the population has recovered to over 21,000. However, increased poaching in recent years has caused the population to decline again.
          </p>
          The Indian rhino population has grown from about 40 in the middle of the last century to more than 4,000 today, thanks to conservation and poaching reduction efforts in India and Nepal.

          <h2>Call for animal protection</h2>
          <p>
            The conservation of animals such as rhinos, elephants and whales is a top priority. They play an important role in the ecosystem, but populations are declining dramatically. To save them, we need to take action. Increased enforcement against poaching, public awareness, habitat protection, international cooperation and global awareness are essential. Protecting animals is not only about them, but also about the survival of the Earth's ecosystem and biodiversity. No sale, no harm, now is the time to act, let's work together to protect these precious creatures and create a better world for the future.
